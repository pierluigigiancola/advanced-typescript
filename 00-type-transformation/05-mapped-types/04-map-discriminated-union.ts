/**

 * - We then take that union memberâ€™s search type via ["search"].

};

// Remapping the keys
/**
 * - R here is the entire object in each union member (e.g., { route: "about", search: {...} }).
 * - Using a key remap (as R["route"]) means we directly use the route string as the property key.
 * - The property value is simply R["search"].
